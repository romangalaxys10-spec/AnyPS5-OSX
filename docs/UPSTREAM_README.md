# About

Tool for automatic executables porting to Linux and Windows.

Includes a [relinker](core/relinker) that converts executable to the target system's native format and implementations of [system prx libraries](core/libs/prx) suitable for dynamic linking. No emulation or separate runtime process.

Releases will be published after the first full successful launch of at least one game.

## Status

Execution reaches `_start`, [stack unwinding](core/libs/prx/libc/src/exception/Unwind.cpp) and exception handling tables are built, reaches main. Unsupported or unexpected states strictly throw `std::runtime_error`. `what()` is printed to stderr and the process terminates.

The [shader recompiler](core/shader/recompiler/Recompiler.cpp) successfully produces validated via [Spirv-Tools](3rdparty/SPIRV-Tools) SPIR-V.

The real game reaches the logo, main menu, and [gameplay](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d28e9b-c237-4545-b2ca-720071129816) with audio.

## Build

The relinker uses only the C++20 standard library and should build with any conforming compiler.

[libc.prx](core/libs/prx/libc) implementations contain compiler-specific code. Linux builds work with GCC; on Windows, MinGW-w64 GCC 15.2.0 (`winlibs-gcc15`, `x86_64-ucrt-posix-seh`) is currently required.

The project targets maximum compiler portability. Support for additional compilers will be addressed after the first successful game launch.
